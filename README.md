	<h1>N0tail</h1>
	<p>Johan "N0tail" Sundstein (formerly known as BigDaddy) (born October 8, 1993) is an inactive Danish/Faeroese player who is currently on the inactive roster of OG.</p>
	<h2>Biography</h2>
	<p>Johan was one of the youngest competitive Heroes of Newerth players in the world, where he played the solo mid role. After the switch to Dota 2, Johan took on the support role, becoming well known for his performances as Chen and Wisp. It was during this transition he quickly developed his micromanagement skills, leading to his renowned Meepo play. Despite his age, Johan was the in-game leader of the Fnatic.EU Dota 2 team.
	</p>
	<h2>Heroes of Newerth</h2>
	<p>Starting as a casual DotA and then Heroes of Newerth player Johan, at the age of 15, met Jascha “NoVa” Markuse and Tal “Fly” Aizik in-game where they decided to start playing together. The group became an unsponsored side project of Fnatic manager Danijel "StreeT" Remus. After changes in the existing Fnatic HoN roster and the promising performances of Johan and his friends the group merged with Fnatic players Henrik "FreshPro" Hansen and Kalle “Trixi” Saarinen. The new Fnatic squad almost immediately began to achieve wins in online tournaments, and soon after obtained their first LAN victory in DreamHack Winter 2011. Along with his team Johan was able to secure 1st place victories in four consecutive DreamHack events.</p>
	<h2>Dota 2<h2>
	<p>As a result of the decreasing activity in the competitive HoN scene Johan transitioned from Heroes of Newerth to Dota 2 with his team-mates Jascha “NoVa” Markuse, Tal “Fly” Aizik and Adrian "Era" Kryeziu on March 30th 2012, remaining under Fnatic.EU banner. Persevering through a difficult start in the competitive Dota 2 scene Fnatic eventually won the Thor Open 2012 LAN event, and have since consistently placed top positions in many major online and LAN tournaments. In April 2013 Johan and his team were invited to compete at Valve's The International 2013 in Seattle. On the months leading up the event Fnatic participated in a Bootcamp in Belgrade Serbia, and ultimately achieved a top 8 finish in the tournament. On the 27th August 2014 BigDaddy bid farewell to Fnatic and had this to say: “Today I'm leaving Fnatic, this has been my first and only organization to play under, but all good things must come to an end. I would like to thank everyone who has supported me through the years, as long as you're watching I will be playing :)”

After The International 2014, N0tail and Fly joined up with ex-Natus Vincere players Puppey and Kuroky, as well as s4 to form Team Secret. His stint in this all-star roster was cut short as he left the team in conjunction with the removal of Fly, and he ended up in Cloud 9 for The International 2015. After an admirable effort in the group stage, the roster fell short during the main stage and he decided to form his own roster following the event. Reuniting with Fly, the two players created (monkey) Business, recruiting talent from different backgrounds and regions. The team later on turned into their own organisation, OG.

OG was N0tail's path to redemption and success alike, with initial success coming at the the Frankfurt Major climbing through the entire lower bracket to take the win against his old team, Team Secret. The season added a second win at a Valve event before The International 2016. At The International 2016 however, the team crumbled during the main stage and the favourites of the tournament were swiftly knocked down to the lower bracket by MVP Phoenix and then knocked out by TNC. The aftermath saw three of his teammates leave the organisation. N0tail rallied together with Fly and once again saw additions from several backgrounds and regions to win two more Valve events prior to The International 2017.

Despite a slow start during The International 2018's group stage, OG finished fourth and were seeded into the upper bracket of the main event. Considered underdogs during their entire time at the event, OG managed to advance to the grand finals and won the tournament by defeating PSG.LGD in the grand final series with a score of 3–2. After winning The International 2018, N0tail was featured in Forbes' 30 under 30 in gaming at the age of 25. The following year, he won The International 2019, making him and OG at the time the first repeat winners of the International.

Despite being inactive from competing since The International 2021, N0tail would clarify during The International 2022 that he is not retired but only taking a break. He would later form a roster called Old G with former teammates Topson and Ceb, the stack did not manage to qualify to DPC 2023 in the first tour, Notail has since noted that at the moment he is not willing to play competitively.</p>
